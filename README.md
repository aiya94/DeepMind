I have created small project  using React framework which run on modern Browser. Project is mobile and laptop friendly for all devices. I build only one unit testing for one components.


### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test` or `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests]

### `yarn build` or `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
